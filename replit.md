# Roblox Friend Viewer - Ultra-Modern 2025

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built to display Roblox user profiles and their friends list with a modern, glowing dark theme. The application consists of a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, designed to provide a visually appealing and responsive interface for exploring Roblox friendship networks.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom dark theme and glowing effects
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx for server-side development

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Full-Stack TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across the entire application stack
2. **Serverless Database**: Using Neon Database for scalable PostgreSQL hosting
3. **Modern UI Framework**: Radix UI provides accessible, unstyled components that can be customized
4. **Monorepo Structure**: Shared schema and types between client and server
5. **Modern Build Tools**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

## Key Components

### Client-Side Components
- **UserProfile**: Displays user information, avatar, and basic stats
- **FriendCard**: Individual friend card with avatar, status, and profile info
- **LoadingSkeleton**: Animated loading states for better UX
- **Toast System**: User feedback for actions and errors

### Server-Side Components
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory implementation
- **Route Registration**: Modular route system for API endpoints
- **Vite Integration**: Development server setup with HMR

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user information (id, username, password)
- **Extensible Design**: Schema designed to accommodate Roblox-specific data

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User enters Roblox User ID in search form
2. **API Requests**: Frontend makes requests to Roblox APIs:
   - Users API for profile information
   - Friends API for friends list
   - Thumbnails API for avatar images
   - Presence API for online status
3. **Data Processing**: Backend processes and enriches data from multiple APIs
4. **State Management**: TanStack Query manages caching and synchronization
5. **UI Updates**: Components re-render with new data and loading states
